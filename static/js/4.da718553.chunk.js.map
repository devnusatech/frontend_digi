In exchange for promoting the business, the affiliate earns a commission for any resulting sales or leads. The commission is usually a percentage of the sale or a flat fee. Affiliates can promote the business through various channels, such as a website, social media, or email marketing. This can be a cost-effective way for businesses to acquire customers and expand their reach, while also providing an opportunity for affiliates to earn money.\n            </div>\n         </div>\n         <div className=\"space-y-3\">\n            <div className=\"text-base leading-normal text-neutral3 dark:text-neutral5\">\n               Benefit Of Digiasset Affiliate Program\n            </div>\n            <ul className=\"list-decimal list-outside text-neutral4 pl-3\">\n               <li>The Commission you get from Direct Referrals is <span className=\"text-primary1 font-medium\">50%</span></li>\n               <li>The Commission you get from Sub Direct Referrals is <span className=\"text-primary1 font-medium\">25%</span></li>\n               <li>The limit of the withdrawal you get is <span className=\"text-primary1 font-medium\">2,000,000</span> when you join this affiliate program <span className=\"text-primary1 font-medium\">is 25%</span></li>\n               <li>\n                  Cost-effective: Affiliate programs are a cost-effective way to acquire customers and increase sales, as the business only pays the affiliate when a sale or lead is generated.\n               </li>\n               <li>\n                  Reach: Affiliates can reach a wider audience than the business would be able to on its own, as they have their own networks and followers.\n               </li>\n               <li>\n                  Increased visibility: Affiliates can promote the business through various channels, such as social media, websites, and email marketing, which can increase the business's visibility and online presence.\n               </li>\n               <li>\n                  Low risk: As the business only pays the affiliate when a sale or lead is generated, there is low risk involved.\n               </li>\n            </ul>\n         </div>\n         <div className=\"text-right\">\n            <Button\n               text=\"Continue\"\n               width=\"noFull\"\n               onClick={() => goToStep(1)}\n            />\n         </div>\n      </div>\n   );\n   const renderStep2 = () => (\n      <div className=\"space-y-8\">\n         <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => goToStep(0)}\n            className=\"group flex items-center text-2xl font-semibold leading-custom2 tracking-custom1\"\n         >\n            <svg className=\"w-3.5 h-3.5 mr-4 fill-neutral4 group-hover:-translate-x-1 transition-all duration-300\">\n               <use xlinkHref=\"#icon-arrow-prev\" />\n            </svg>\n            Social Media Link\n         </button>\n         <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Instagram\"\n               placeholder=\"eg. instagram.com/airdrops....\"\n            />\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Twitter\"\n               placeholder=\"eg. twitter.com/airdrops....\"\n            />\n         </div>\n         <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Youtube\"\n               placeholder=\"eg. youtube.com/sosmed....\"\n            />\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Telegram\"\n               placeholder=\"eg. t.me/grouptele....\"\n            />\n         </div>\n         <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Tiktok\"\n               placeholder=\"eg. tiktok.com/grouptele....\"\n            />\n            <InputGroup\n               label=\"Other\"\n               placeholder=\"Another Social Media Link (Optional)\"\n            />\n         </div>\n         <div className=\"text-right\">\n            <Button\n               text=\"Continue\"\n               width=\"noFull\"\n               onClick={toggle}\n            />\n         </div>\n      </div>\n   );\n   const renderModalSuccess = () => (\n      <Portal\n         show={isShow}\n         close={toggle}\n      >\n         <div className=\"mt-10 space-y-8\">\n            <div className=\"text-5xl text-center font-dm font-bold leading-custom1 tracking-custom\">\n               Yay! 🎉\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"text-neutral4 leading-normal text-center\">\n               Your Affiliate request was successful, the request will be processed in approximately 2 x 24 hours.
